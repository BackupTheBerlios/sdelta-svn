I implemented minor tuning to blocks.c and sdelta3.c
that overall produces smaller compressed patches.
Pavel Gorshkov added support for both gnutls 1.2.x and 1.0.x
I modified the Makefiles to automatically compile and
link sdelta3 with available libraries that it requires.
Few modifications are left before sdelta3 is released.
sdreq should be modified to automatically request and
download 7za compressed sdelta3 patches instead of
patches in the original sdelta format.

Unfortunately, patch production has been offline
for at least 4 days if not more because berlios.de
has neglected starting cron.
Patch production is dependent on cron 
running and their http server working.
Neither have been dependable recently.
Anyone know a good home for the PPR?

This release introduces sdelta3.
sdelta3 produces smaller compressed
patches than sdelta and sdelta2.

sdelta3 is less complex.
sdelta3 does not use hashes nor CRC lists.
Instead it combines the best technologies of
sdelta and sdelta2 while eliminating the dubious overhead.
sdelta3 demonstrates an effective delta generator
can be created using only one sorted arrays of blocks
in addition to the content of the files being compared.

Don't forget to update sdreq for sdelta 3
