This release introduces sdelta3.
sdelta3 produces smaller compressed
patches than sdelta and sdelta2.

sdelta3 is less complex.
sdelta3 does not use hashes nor CRC lists.
Instead it combines the best technologies of
sdelta and sdelta2 while eliminating the dubious overhead.
sdelta3 demonstrates an effective delta generator
can be created using only one sorted arrays of blocks
in addition to the content of the files being compared.

Don't forget to update sdreq for sdelta 3
